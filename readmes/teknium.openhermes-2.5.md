## Dataset Details

### Dataset Description

The Open Hermes 2/2.5 and Nous Hermes 2 models have made significant advancements of SOTA LLM's over recent months, and are underpinned by this exact compilation and curation of many open source datasets and custom created synthetic datasets.

The Open Hermes 2.5 dataset is a continuation of the Open Hermes 1 dataset, at a much larger scale, much more diverse, and much higher quality compilation, reaching 1M, primarily synthetically generated instruction and chat samples.

## Lilac Integration

This dataset has been pushed to Lilac's (a data curation and exploration platform) live HuggingFace spaces, that hosts many popular OS Datasets for exploration and curation, as well as does Text Embedding searches and Clustering of those datasets

## Dataset Structure

The dataset follows a sharegpt structure. This means it is a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary containing a new list of dicts called conversations. Each turn in a conversation has two dictionaries, a "from" field, which denotes the role of that turn, and a "value" field which contains the actual text.

Here is an example of an entry:

```
    {
        "conversations": [
            {
                "from": "system",
                "value": ""
            },
            {
                "from": "human",
                "value": "Every day, a tree drops 7 leaves. How many leaves would it drop in a month of February in a non-leap year? Include your logic."
            },
            {
                "from": "gpt",
                "value": "Here's the logic behind this:\n\n1. We know that February has 28 days in a non-leap year.\n2. If the tree drops 7 leaves every day, then over the course of February, it would drop:\n   Leaves dropped in February = Leaves per day * Days in February\n   = 7 leaves * 28 days\n   = 196 leaves\n\nSo, the tree would drop 196 leaves in February in a non-leap year."
            }
        ],
        "source": "airoboros2.2",
        "category": "orca"
    },
```

Some examples, like the one above, contain the metadata that came with the dataset, such as "category" being "orca", and many contain the source dataset that it was curated from.
