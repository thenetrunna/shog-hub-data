![OI-O1-BannerDemo-2](https://www.openinterpreter.com/OI-O1-BannerDemo-3.jpg)

We want to help you build. [Apply for 1-on-1 support.](https://0ggfznkwh4j.typeform.com/to/kkStE8WF)

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This experimental project is under rapid development and lacks basic safeguards. Until a stable `1.0` release, only run this repository on devices without sensitive information or access to paid services.
>
> **A substantial rewrite to address these concerns and more, including the addition of [RealtimeTTS](https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeTTS) and [RealtimeSTT](https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeSTT), is occurring [here](https://github.com/KillianLucas/01-rewrite/tree/main).**

<br>

**The 01 Project** is building an open-source ecosystem for AI devices.

Our flagship operating system can power conversational devices like the Rabbit R1, Humane Pin, or [Star Trek computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZXugicgn6U).

We intend to become the GNU/Linux of this space by staying open, modular, and free.

<br>

# Software

```shell
git clone https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/01 # Clone the repository
cd 01/software # CD into the source directory
```

<!-- > Not working? Read our [setup guide](https://docs.openinterpreter.com/getting-started/setup). -->

```shell
brew install portaudio ffmpeg cmake # Install Mac OSX dependencies
poetry install # Install Python dependencies
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk... # OR run `poetry run 01 --local` to run everything locally
poetry run 01 # Runs the 01 Light simulator (hold your spacebar, speak, release)
```

<!-- > For a Windows installation, read our [setup guide](https://docs.openinterpreter.com/getting-started/setup#windows). -->

<br>

**The [RealtimeTTS](https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeTTS) and [RealtimeSTT](https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeSTT) libraries in the incoming 01-rewrite are thanks to the state-of-the-art voice interface work of [Kolja Beigel](https://github.com/KoljaB). Please star those repos and consider contributing to / utilizing those projects!**

# Hardware

- The **01 Light** is an ESP32-based voice interface. Build instructions are [here](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/01/tree/main/hardware/light). A list of what to buy [here](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/01/blob/main/hardware/light/BOM.md).
- It works in tandem with the **01 Server** ([setup guide below](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/01/blob/main/README.md#01-server)) running on your home computer.
- **Mac OSX** and **Ubuntu** are supported by running `poetry run 01` (**Windows** is supported experimentally). This uses your spacebar to simulate the 01 Light.
- (coming soon) The **01 Heavy** is a standalone device that runs everything locally.

**We need your help supporting & building more hardware.** The 01 should be able to run on any device with input (microphone, keyboard, etc.), output (speakers, screens, motors, etc.), and an internet connection (or sufficient compute to run everything locally).

# What does it do?

The 01 exposes a speech-to-speech websocket at `localhost:10001`.

If you stream raw audio bytes to `/` in [Streaming LMC format](https://docs.openinterpreter.com/guides/streaming-response), you will receive its response in the same format.

Inspired in part by [Andrej Karpathy's LLM OS](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1723140519554105733), we run a [code-interpreting language model](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter), and call it when certain events occur at your computer's [kernel](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/01/blob/main/software/source/server/utils/kernel.py).

The 01 wraps this in a voice interface:

# Protocols

## LMC Messages

To communicate with different components of this system, we introduce [LMC Messages](https://docs.openinterpreter.com/protocols/lmc-messages) format, which extends OpenAI’s messages format to include a "computer" role:

https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/01/assets/63927363/8621b075-e052-46ba-8d2e-d64b9f2a5da9

## Dynamic System Messages

Dynamic System Messages enable you to execute code inside the LLM's system message, moments before it appears to the AI.

```python
# Edit the following settings in i.py
interpreter.system_message = r" The time is {{time.time()}}. " # Anything in double brackets will be executed as Python
interpreter.chat("What time is it?") # It will know, without making a tool/API call
```

# Guides

## 01 Server

To run the server on your Desktop and connect it to your 01 Light, run the following commands:

```shell
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok
ngrok authtoken ... # Use your ngrok authtoken
poetry run 01 --server --expose
```

The final command will print a server URL. You can enter this into your 01 Light's captive WiFi portal to connect to your 01 Server.

## Local Mode

```
poetry run 01 --local
```

If you want to run local speech-to-text using Whisper, you must install Rust. Follow the instructions given [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Customizations

To customize the behavior of the system, edit the [system message, model, skills library path,](https://docs.openinterpreter.com/settings/all-settings) etc. in `i.py`. This file sets up an interpreter, and is powered by Open Interpreter.

## Ubuntu Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev ffmpeg cmake
```
